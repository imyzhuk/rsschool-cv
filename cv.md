## About me

I can concentrate on one thing for a long time and like to learn new.

My main programming's goal is getting pleasure. I think so now and i thought so when i have started programming. Even now i remember how i created my first program. it was only able to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers which some user could input into it. But when my program had started to work i was delighted. I cried "I'm a real IT-citizen"(Belarus is just an IT-country, isn't it?).
